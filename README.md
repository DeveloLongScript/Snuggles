# Overview

Welcome to Snuggles: a general purpose Discord bot with the goal of putting an end to outdated practices, half-assed features and having essentials locked behind a paywall. Unlike other bots, Snuggles remains not only feature rich, but also beautifully simple, creating the most refined, perfected and bloat-free experiences for you, along with your members.

# Highlights
* **Free & open source** - Protected by the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/UwUAroze/Snuggles/blob/master/LICENSE), we embrace the open source community; you guys. Feel free to contribute, make suggestions or even create your own sub-projects.
* **Painless & idiot-proof** - When designing even the smallest interactions with Snuggles, we've made sure to look from the perspective of a user, not a developer. From settings UI's to command parameters, everything works just how you'd expect, and feels natural.
* **Looks matter** - Functionality aside, we strive for and take pride in our attention to detail; an area I often notice severely lacking in even the most popular of Discord bots, and something I've taken upon myself to alleviate.

# Bot modules

* **Message logging** - a must-have feature for server moderation. Regardless of being resource intensive, with Snuggles, you can enjoy the piece of mind of being able to see any deletions or edits to messages/attachments, for upto 7 days after they were sent, free, forever.

* **Counting** - ~~Dead server?~~ Snuggles has you covered with a counting feature. For those who don't know how these work, the count starts at 0 and users must count in order... that's kinda it. Counting channels are a really fun way to liven your community, and Snuggles makes it easy, also adding it's own unique twist on how it interacts with users.

* **Feeling commands** - Want to express your love, appreciation, or frustration with your fellow Discord users? Snuggles provides a large range of feeling commands. Give your friends a hug, or let them know they're being a little too much with a good old fashioned slap ;) These commands have hundreds of unique messages, and even more unique responses under certain circumstances. They always feel genuine, unrepetitive and are super fun to mess around with.
