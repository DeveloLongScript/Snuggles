# Snuggles config!
# This is not a config for servers, but for the bot itself; you should only worry about this if you're self-hosting.
#
# Incase you mess up bad, you can find the original config for reference here:
# https://github.com/UwUAroze/Snuggles/tree/v2/src/main/resources/config.toml
# Alternatively you can just delete this file and restart the bot, generating a new one for you.
